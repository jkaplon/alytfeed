========

This repository contains the RSS feed for the [At Least You're Trying](http://gtradio.net/alyt) podcast.
It may seem odd to have my podcast feed on github, but I assure you that it's a key piece of an overly-complex (but valuable) workflow.
I configured the github webook to notify the server hosting the official podcast feed every time I push a new episode into the feed.
A Sinatra service running on my VPS over at [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=30991a143a3c99716fbc7fdcf81355338c4d2b64) takes care of the subsequent cloning and file system housekeeping.

The purpose of this Github repository is to provide off-site backup of the feed's version history while using Github's webhook features to push feed updates to other necessary destinations.
